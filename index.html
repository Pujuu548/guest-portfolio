          Neeraj Chopra is an Indian track and field athlete and javelin
          thrower. He is the first Indian track and field athlete to win an
          Olympic gold medal. He is also the first Asian athlete to win an
          Olympic gold medal in javelin and the first Asian to win gold in his
          event at the World Championship
        </p>
        <p>
          The turning point in Neeraj's life came when he decided to join the
          Athletics Academy in Panchkula. Under the guidance of experienced
          coaches, he honed his skills and gradually transformed from a
          promising talent to a force to be reckoned with. It wasn't long before
          he started breaking records at the national level, leaving spectators
          in awe of his raw talent and determination. But every hero's journey
          is marked by challenges, and Neeraj's path was no exception. In 2018,
          an unfortunate injury threatened to derail his dreams.</p>
		  <p2>It was a
          setback that could have easily shattered the spirit of any athlete.
          However, Neeraj, fueled by an indomitable will, embraced the adversity
          and embarked on a journey of recovery that showcased his resilience.
          The year 2021 dawned as a pivotal chapter in Neeraj's story.</p2><br>
		   
		
		  <p3> The Tokyo
          Olympics loomed on the horizon, and he was determined to make a mark.
          The world watched with bated breath as Neeraj Chopra stepped onto the
          grand stage, the Olympic Stadium, carrying the hopes of a nation. In a
          moment that would be etched in the annals of Indian sports history,
          Neeraj unleashed a throw that soared through the air with unparalleled
          grace and precision. The javelin pierced the Tokyo sky, carrying not
          just the dreams of a young man but the aspirations of a billion
          hearts. Neeraj Chopra had clinched the gold, becoming India's
          first-ever Olympic gold medalist in athletics.</p3>
